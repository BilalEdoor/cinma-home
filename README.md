## Cinema at home

This document describes the structure and possible improvements of the "Cinema at home" web page.

**Current structure:**

* **HTML:**
* External stylesheet (`stylesheet.css`) and Font Awesome library for icons.
* Title: "Cinema at home"
* Text content with main sections:
* `section class="home"` with subsections:
* `class="home-content"` - social media text and icons
* `class="main-img"` - background image
* Script (`app.js`) for interaction
* **Suggestions:**
* Content: Explain services (movies, series, unique features).
* Social media links: Add links to social media profiles.
* Design: Customize styles in `stylesheet.css`.
* Functions: Add functions to the button (for example, redirect).
* Image: Replace the placeholder image with a more appropriate image.

**Improvements:**

1. **Header:**
* Create `<header>` using:
* Logo (`<a>`) - Text: "Cinema at Home" (Link: "#")
* Navigation menu (`<nav>`)
2. **Navigation menu:**
* Create `<nav>` using:
* Unordered list (`<ul>`) containing menu items (`<li>`).
* Each menu item contains anchor tags (`<a>`) for different sections (About Us, Our Movies, Series, Favorites, Contact Us).
* Login button (`<button>`) that triggers the `goToNextPage` function (loginpage.html).
3. **Content sections:**
* Use JavaScript to identify sections by identifier (e.g. #section1).
* Create content (headings, paragraphs, image containers) within each section based on its purpose (About Us, Movies/Series cards, etc.).
4. **Movie Cards:**
* Define an array (`cardData`) containing movie information:
* Image source
* Title
* Description
* Button text
* Iterate through the array to create individual cards using:
* Card element (`<div class="card">`)
* Banner image (`<div>`) with background based on image source.
* Wrapper (`<div>`) for title and description.
* Button wrapper (`<div>`) with "Watch" button.
5. **Series Cards:**
* Similar approach to movie cards. Use a separate array (`cardData5`) containing series information.
6. **Smooth Navigation and Scrolling:**
* Define navigation links (`nav a`).
* Add a click event listener to prevent default link behavior.
* Retrieve the target section id from the link's "href" attribute.
* Use JavaScript to smoothly scroll through the window to the target section.
7. **Animations (requires GSAP library):**
* (Optional) Write code using the GSAP library for animation effects (fade and move up) on card elements.

**Overall:**

This improved structure creates a user-friendly website with navigation, informational sections for movies and series, and optional animation features.
